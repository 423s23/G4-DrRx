# ESOF423-Project

This is a repository for the 2023 ESOF423 Project working on the problem established by Dr. Bain focusing on helping create a tool for more practical and efficent prognosis of patients by answering series of questions, in the form of a java based executable software.

## Documentation for Users
Description of the Project
This is a Zero Feature Release of the DrRx software. It is able to open a window with placeholders for Mental Health Questionnaires and a Patient Information collection placeholder.

To Obtain and Install the Software
Within this repository, navigate through to the Project/JavaCode folder. Inside is three files, Questionnaire_Application, Questions, and application; download all three and place them all within the same folder, perferably onto the desktop. The DrRx software is now installed.

To Run the Software
Find the folder on your desktop where the three files are located. Double click on the application.jar file to open and run the software.

To Use the Software
With the DrRx software running, a fullscreen window will appear. The current buttons include: Personal Info, Quiz 1, Quiz 2, Quiz 3 and Quiz 4. Click on a button to open another window. To use the quiz window in this release, open a quiz by clicking the corresponding button, select one option for an answer. The 'Next' button is currently inactive. To return to the main questionnaire window, close the current window in the upper right corner.

To Report a Bug
In the case a bug should occur, take a screenshot of the bug you see in the application window and write a brief summary of the events leading up to when this bug occured. This information can be sent to aurora.duskin@ecat1.montana.edu.

## Documentation for Developers
* how to obtain the source code, including at a minimum: How to obtain the source code for the latest stable/released version. Where to find the source code repository that you will use for development.
* layout of directory structure: what the various directories contain, or where to find important information such as source files, documentation, data files, etc.
* how to build/compile the software. In some cases, such as you are building a stand alone application, there may not be any build instructions. If so, you should state that explicitly.
* How	to	test	the	software	(e.g.,	run	the	test	suite).	In	some	cases,	the	instructions	may	need	to	include	information	such	as	how	to	access	data	sources	(e.g.,	how	to	create	and	populate	a	database),	similarly	to	or	in	addition	to	what	a	user	must	do.	For	example	if	your	software	is	a	website	or	web	service,	the	developer	documentation	must	include	everything	a	programmer	must	do	in	order	to	get	a	test	version	of	the	website	up	and	running	your	software.	You	may	reference	the	user	documentation	to	avoid	duplication.
* How	to	set	up	an	automated	weekly (or	more	frequent)	build	and	test.	For	your	weekly build	and	test,	you	may	wish	to	use Travis, Jenkins, cron,	or similar	software.	Also	describe	how	you	set	up your daily	build	and	test	system,	and	how	you	ensured	that	any	failure	output	is	emailed	to	your	entire	team.	(Don’t	describe	how	you	might	have	done	it	or	how	you	plan	to	do	it;	actually	do	it,	and	describe	what	you	did.)	It	is	a	requirement	that	before	the	due	date,	at	least	one	failing	daily	test	result	is	automatically	emailed	to	the	team.	This	obviously	requires	that	at	least	some	tests	already	exist.	We	do	not	require	any successful daily	tests	yet.
* How	to	release	a	new	version	of	your	software. After	you	are	happy	that	a	new	version	of	your	product	is	ready	to	be	released,	making	a	release	involves	steps	such	as: Updating	revision	numbers	in	your	code	and	documentation. Creating	the	zip	file,	tar	file,	or	other	package	that	a	user	or	developer	will	download	to	obtain	your	product.	If	you	have	multiple	downloads	(say,	a	source	and	a	binary	release),	then	each	must	be	created. Copying	files	to	your	website,	so	that	the	new	version	is	visible	to	the	world. Sanity-checking	that	the	website	and	downloadable	files	are	as	you	wish.	For	instance,	after	making	a	release	but	before	publicizing	it,	you	should	check	that all	the	links	work,	download	the	software	from	a	fresh	account	(with	none	of	your	own	personal	customizations)	and	run	its	tests,	etc. Your	instructions	should	make	clear	how	to	control	the	website	to	which	your	files	are	copied.	For	example,	it	is	recommended	that	a	developer	can	create	a	private	release	(sometimes	called	a	testing	release).	That	way,	you	can	test	your	software	without	breaking	the	publicly-available	version.
* How	to	access	the	list	of	outstanding	bugs	and	the	list	of	resolved	bugs,	and	how	to	resolve	a	bug.	(This	can	be	simply	a	URL	for	your	issue	tracker.)	For	the	ZFR,	your	bug	tracking	system	need	not	have	a	comprehensive	list	of	every	last	bug	and	missing	feature.	However,	for	this	and	future	assignments,	if	we	run across	a	problem	while	using	your	software,	you	will	regain	some	credit	if	the	bug	tracking	system	contains	a	description	of	the	problem.
* The	source	code	should	contain	comments.	At	a minimum,	every	file	should	have	a	comment	describing	its	purpose	and,	if	appropriate	or	not	obvious,	how	it	fits	into	your	overall	design.	Every	procedure	is	required	to	have	at	least	a	one-sentence	comment	describing	what	it	does—or	more	if	appropriate.	Your	source	code	will	be	graded	based	on	whether	it demonstrates	the	following	attributes: work	and	effort, clearly	and	elegantly	designed, documented	(both	at	a	high	and	a	low	level	of	detail),	and general	cleanliness	and	elegance	of	the	code.
