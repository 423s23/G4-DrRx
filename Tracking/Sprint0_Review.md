After having met with Dr. Bains about the project, we were made aware that we had been moving in the wrong direction for our zero feature release. Rather than act as a questionnaire for users to answer, our software should instead use the results from a pre-completed 3rd party questionnaire and compile the results into organized data intended for the doctor to review and compare.

Knowing this, the beta release of this software will be a reconstruction of our product with a basic version of the ideal functionality, which can be reviewed by Dr. Bains at a later date.
