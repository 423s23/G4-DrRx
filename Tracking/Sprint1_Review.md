After being made aware that we were moving in the wrong direction for our product during Sprint 0, we have reconstructed our program to hopefully represent the starting points of some of the product's desired functionalities.

Now, our product can receive a patient's name from a user, find a matching value within a supplied CSV file and produce the patient's associated information. Going forward for Sprint 2, we will implement the start of the desired algorithm to make recommendations based on the patient's data.
